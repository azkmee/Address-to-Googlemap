# Address-to-Googlemap
Code to read addresses in an csv file and type it in a google map for directions

This code is created to optimize the working operation of a delivery person entering an already optimzed route in googlemap. Currently, the landsmarks are being imported to flightmap to optained the sequence of destinations. The code helps to key in multiple destinations into googlemap and allow user to saved the direction to his phone for use.

The code requires a csv file, named Flightmap.csv, which contains the addresses for the routes.
